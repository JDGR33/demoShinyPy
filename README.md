# Project aim
Build a production ready Shiny app that showcase the power of the framework to build Web Application.

Mock "Client email":

_We have a SQL database with food prices around the year and the exchange rate. We would like a web application where we could monitor the prices and the exchange rate._

_Our team will like to have a form where they could log events during the year useful for feature analysis of the food prices and the exchange rate._

_We would like to manage the users and have two types of users: those who can only look at the data and editors who can use the form to register especial events_

_We would like to remember you that our corporate image is VERY important to us and this application will also be share with clients._

_Our team could hire someone to work on the app after you finish it, so we hope everything is properly document and production ready._
